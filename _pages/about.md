I am Canadian economics student finisning my last semester at Toronto Metropolitan Univeristy who is currently studying for the CFA level 1 exam in May 2026. In my downtime, my interests range from practicing piano to reading the great authors like Dostodevsky or optiziming my conveyer belts on Factorio. 

 Check out my [Substack](https://www.hedgeandtheory.com) where I write out mainly nomrative essays on interesting economics.

What I'm working on
======
Besides hitting the books, there are numerous things I am currently working on. First, is enhancing my technical experise in various softwares like Excel and Python by completing course work on websites like Udemy and Coursera. In addition to technicality, I am working on building my brand, "Hedge & Theory" acorss multiple domains like X, Substack, Linkedin, and possibly YouTube to take a stance in the battlefield of ideas. Where anti-capitalist sentiment seems to be  growing despite its insurmountable transformation of human prosperity. Therefore, a free market school of thought must be vehemently fought over for posterity. 

Some of my favourite writers. 

- [John Cochrane](https://www.grumpy-economist.com/) for essays on economics
- [Aswath Damodaran](https://aswathdamodaran.substack.com/?utm_campaign=profile_chips) for capital markets
- [Richard Werner](https://rwerner.substack.com/) for economic analysis

My vision
======
As I enter my mid twenties, my focus is aimed towards breaking into the buy-side, more specifically, managing equity portfolios with a sepcialization in derivatives. As for education, I strive to become a CFA charterholder within the next several years with the addtion of pursuing graduate school. Ideally, in my late twenties, I dream of managing my own fund with a macroeconomic-driven style of investing. Beyond this point, it is hard to pinpoint exactly what I would desire to accomplish but one thing is for certain as I leave twenties and into my thirties. Canada is a country that I was born and raised in, one to which I love dearly, therefore, a shift into politics would seem very rationale some time in my thirties. I would serve to make Canada one of the wealthiest countries in the world with immense capital investment flowing into our country.

This is as far as I thought about in terms of my future, but, of course anything can happen that change the trajectory of everything for the better or unfortunately, for the worse.
